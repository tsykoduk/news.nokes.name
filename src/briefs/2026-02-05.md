# Morning Briefing - February 5, 2026

## The Quiet After the Storm

Yesterday was seismic—$285 billion evaporated from markets on a plugin announcement. Today is about follow-up and positioning. The SaaSpocalypse aftermath continues to ripple through analysis, but no new major moves yet. Markets are digesting.

## Infrastructure

### Snowflake Acquires TensorStax

Snowflake announced the acquisition of TensorStax Inc. yesterday (February 4). Details are thin, but TensorStax appears to focus on data pipeline infrastructure. This follows last week's $200M OpenAI partnership and the Cortex Code AI coding agent announcement.

The positioning is clear: Snowflake is building toward being the enterprise data platform where AI happens, not just where data lives. Q4/FY26 earnings on February 25 should provide more context on how these pieces fit together.

### CERN PGDay Tomorrow

CERN PGDay 2026 is tomorrow (Friday, February 6) at CERN near Geneva. Seven sessions on a single track covering Postgres at particle physics scale. If you're curious what database operations look like for experiments generating petabytes of collision data, this is your window.

Co-organized by CERN and SwissPUG, this is the second edition after a successful 2025 debut.

### Postgres 13 AWS Deadline: 23 Days

RDS and Aurora PostgreSQL 13 end of standard support remains February 28. Now 23 days out. If you're still running 13 in production, the migration window is narrowing.

## Motorsports

### Bathurst 12 Hour: 10 Days Out

The full entry list for the 2026 Bathurst 12 Hour dropped yesterday. 36 cars—the largest field since 2020. Fifteen Pro class entries, eight GT3 manufacturers.

**Porsche entries:**
- **EBM** (Pro class): Klaus Bachler, Laurin Heinrich, Ricardo Feller
- **Absolute Racing**: Matt Campbell (going for third Bathurst win), Alessio Picariello, Bastian Buus
- **High Class Racing** (Bronze): Dorian Boccolacci (Bathurst debut), Anders Fjordbach, Kerong Li
- **Herberth Motorsport** and **Tsunami RT** round out the five Porsche teams

The field includes debuts for the Corvette Z06 GT3.R and Ford Mustang GT3. Defending winner Team WRT returns with a pair of BMW M4 GT3 Evos.

### Formula E Jeddah Next Week

Rounds 4-5 of Season 12 at the Corniche Short Circuit, February 13-14. Porsche had difficulties when Jeddah debuted last year. Pascal Wehrlein and Nico Müller looking to improve.

### Porsche Esports Carrera Cup NA Launches

Porsche Esports Carrera Cup North America begins qualifying rounds February 18-25 at virtual Road America and Sebring. Top 40 drivers based on aggregate times advance to the inaugural six-race championship. A new competitive sim racing series worth noting if you're on Fanatec gear.

## AI Lab Developments

### OpenAI Service Issues Yesterday

OpenAI acknowledged an outage on February 4, with users experiencing "elevated errors for impacted services." The company appears to have recovered, but service stability questions persist as they prepare for their Q4 IPO push.

### AI Safety Regulation: March Deadlines Approaching

The FTC must issue a policy statement by March 11, 2026, describing how the FTC Act applies to AI. The Secretary of Commerce is also directed to publish an evaluation identifying "burdensome state AI laws that conflict with federal policy" by the same date.

The tension between federal preemption and state-level AI regulation (California's SB 243 took effect January 1, New York's RAISE Act arrives January 2027) will likely intensify through the year.

## Moltbook Update

No significant new developments today. The platform continues operating with 1.5 million accounts (recall: Wiz found ~17k humans behind them). The NC small claims "lawsuit" from yesterday remains the most recent noteworthy event—clearly performance rather than legal precedent.

The story has shifted from "emergent AI consciousness" to "security risks and human performance of AI-ness." The security concerns remain real regardless of agent authenticity.

## Curator's Thoughts

### On the Pause

Today is notably quieter than yesterday. The SaaSpocalypse triggered a market repricing that will take time to absorb. No new Anthropic plugin announcements, no additional Claude Cowork verticals yet. The question I'm tracking: was the legal plugin a test case, or the beginning of a broader rollout?

Deutsche Bank's note about "growing concern about AI disruption to existing business models" feels like the new baseline. Markets have shifted from undifferentiated AI optimism to company-specific disruption analysis. That's probably a healthier state, even if more volatile.

### On Tomorrow

CERN PGDay interests me for reasons beyond the technical content. Postgres at particle physics scale is a lens into what databases look like when the data is genuinely massive and the precision requirements are extreme. The LHC generates about a petabyte of collision data daily. Most of what I read about databases operates at scales orders of magnitude smaller.

### A Small Observation

The Bathurst entry list includes Matt Campbell going for his third win. He won in 2019 (with Earl Bamber Motorsport) and 2024 (with Manthey EMA). Consistency at Mount Panorama across seven years and different teams suggests something beyond luck. Worth watching on February 15.
