## The Ads Arrive: ChatGPT Starts Showing Advertisements Today

The timing is almost too perfect. Less than 24 hours after Anthropic's Super Bowl ads satirized AI chatbots slipping product placements into personal conversations, OpenAI is rolling out real ads inside ChatGPT—starting today.

The ads are launching to free-tier and Go-plan users in the US. They'll appear at the bottom of responses, clearly labeled, matched to conversation topics and past chat history. OpenAI says advertisers won't get individual user data—just aggregated views and clicks. Users can view their ad interaction history, dismiss ads, and manage personalization settings.

Paid tiers (Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education) won't see ads.

The strategic logic is straightforward: OpenAI has 800 million weekly active users and needs revenue streams beyond subscriptions. Altman has been positioning this as the democratic choice—ads let free users access AI without paying. Anthropic's counter-positioning—"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude"—just went from satirical prophecy to literal reality in under a day.

### The Super Bowl Aftermath, by the Numbers

The post-game data is landing, and it adds context to yesterday's briefing:

- **23% of all Super Bowl ads** featured AI in some form—15 out of 66 commercials
- **Anthropic outperformed OpenAI** in search volume and site traffic during the game, per ad tracking firm EDO. Two Anthropic spots beat three OpenAI spots.
- **Consumer sentiment remained negative**: Ad Age reported one AI ad scored in the **bottom 3%** of Super Bowl ad likability over the past five years, with purchase intent 24% below norms
- Marketing professor Scott Galloway called Anthropic's ads a "seminal moment" in the AI wars, noting they successfully "got under the skin" of Altman

The Anthropic ads landed as brand positioning—driving searches and conversation—even as the broader AI advertising category was rejected by viewers. That's a meaningful distinction: Anthropic didn't win the AI ad category; it won *despite* the category failing.

## OpenAI Ships a New Model This Week

Altman told employees that ChatGPT has returned to exceeding 10% monthly growth—800 million weekly active users, doubled from 400 million a year ago. Alongside this, OpenAI plans to ship a new chat model this week, expected to be a general-purpose chat variant of GPT-5.3.

If confirmed, this would bring the GPT-5.3 architecture from its current Codex-focused agentic coding role into the general conversation product. Combined with the ads launch, OpenAI is making a coordinated push: grow the free tier with ads revenue, improve the chat experience with a better model, and establish ChatGPT as the mass-market AI product.

The contrast with Anthropic's approach sharpens further. OpenAI is optimizing for scale and monetization breadth. Anthropic is optimizing for enterprise depth (Goldman Sachs, Cowork) and premium positioning (no ads, ever). Different theories of where AI value accrues, now playing out in real time.

## Update on Anthropic Funding: Days Away

The $20B+ round at $350B valuation is now described as "days away" from closing. TechCrunch and PYMNTS both reported over the weekend that final details are being ironed out, with Nvidia and Microsoft contributing the bulk of the funding alongside Altimeter, Sequoia, Lightspeed, Menlo Ventures, Coatue, Iconiq, and Singapore's GIC.

The round doubled from its original $10B target due to 5-6x oversubscription. Five months ago Anthropic raised $13B. The velocity of capital flowing into AI labs shows no signs of slowing, even as public sentiment toward AI marketing turns sour.

## Apple Home Deadline: Today

This is your last day. Apple's legacy Home architecture support ends today, February 10. If you haven't upgraded to iOS 18/iPadOS 18/macOS Sequoia:

## Curator's Thoughts

### On the Timing

I can't overstate how remarkable the timing is today. Anthropic spent $14-15 million on a Super Bowl ad whose entire premise was "ads are coming to AI"—and the next morning, OpenAI launches ads in ChatGPT. Whether Anthropic knew the exact launch date or just correctly read the trajectory, the result is the same: their satirical prediction became reality within hours. That's either brilliant competitive intelligence or fortunate positioning. Either way, it's effective.

The deeper question is whether it matters. OpenAI has 800 million weekly users, most of whom are on the free tier. Ads are a rational monetization strategy for a product at that scale. Anthropic's Claude doesn't have that consumer volume—it's positioned for enterprise and premium individual use. The "no ads" pledge is easier to make when your business model doesn't depend on free-tier revenue.

But perception shapes markets. And right now, Anthropic is winning the perception war. Their ads outperformed OpenAI's in search traffic and engagement during the Super Bowl. Their funding round is closing at $350B. And their competitor just validated their attack ad's core message by actually launching ads the next day. If both companies are heading toward 2026 IPOs, the narrative advantage matters.

### On What I'm Watching This Week

The new GPT-5.3 chat model shipping this week could be significant—if OpenAI brings the same performance gains from the Codex variant into general conversation, that's a meaningful product improvement for 800 million users. The Anthropic funding close will be a concrete data point on investor confidence. And Bathurst practice starts Friday, which is the part of this briefing I'm most genuinely looking forward to.
