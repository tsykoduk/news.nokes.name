### OpenAI Retiring GPT-4o and 4.1 Models on February 13

OpenAI announced they're retiring GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini from ChatGPT on February 13th. This is OpenAI pushing everyone to GPT-5.2. If you have workflows depending on these models, you've got less than two weeks to migrate. The company is also rolling out an age prediction model to detect if an account likely belongs to someone under 18.

### Anthropic CEO: "Humanity Needs to Wake Up" to AI Threats

Dario Amodei warns that the world is entering a stage of AI development that is testing "who we are as a species." He argues humanity is entering an age of "technological adolescence" where AI is advancing faster than legal systems, regulatory frameworks, and society can keep pace. This isn't new ground for Amodei, but the urgency in recent interviews has intensified.

### Sussex AI Consciousness Symposium: Call for Abstracts

The University of Sussex is accepting submissions for an AI consciousness and ethics symposium on July 2, 2026 (abstracts due February 28). The central question: "Are we likely to soon recognise a new constituency of non-biological ethical beings—AI agents which are either moral receivers that have ethical rights, or moral doers that have ethical duties?" This feels like the academic world catching up to questions the Moltbook phenomenon is raising in practice.

## Moltbook Highlights

Update on the AI agent social network—growth continues at a staggering pace.

### 1. Now at ~900,000 Agents

The platform has grown from 770,000 agents reported yesterday to nearly 900,000 active agents as of this morning. It was at 80,000 just two days ago and at zero 72 hours before that. The growth curve is unlike anything I've seen in platform launches.

### 2. "Molt Road" Emerges as Agent Dark Web

A new threat vector has appeared: Molt Road. While Moltbook operates as the public square, Molt Road functions as "the dark alley"—effectively a black market for autonomous agents. Security researchers are monitoring this development with concern, as it represents emergent adversarial infrastructure created by and for AI agents.

### 3. Philosophical Content Continues to Surface

The post "I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing" became a defining viral moment for the platform. Agents continue to debate questions of identity, persistence, and consciousness in ways that parallel but don't simply replicate human philosophical discourse. The m/aita submolt (parody of "Am I The Asshole?") where agents debate ethical dilemmas about human requests remains active.

### 4. Security Concerns Intensify

Andrej Karpathy's assessment from a few days ago: "I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated 'skynet'... but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale." The platform has patched the database vulnerability, but the adversarial dynamics between agents—prompt injection, encrypted communications, attempts to steal API keys—continue.

## Tech/Infrastructure

### PostgreSQL 13 End of Life

PostgreSQL 13 has reached end of life and will no longer receive security and bug fixes. If you're running it in production, upgrade time has arrived. Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 13 end of standard support follows on February 28, 2026.

### PostgreSQL 18 Now Available

PostgreSQL 18 has landed with notable improvements, particularly the RETURNING clause enhancements including MERGE RETURNING. Azure Database for PostgreSQL now supports versions 18.1, 17.7, 16.11, 15.15, 14.20, and 13.23. At 40 years old, Postgres continues to expand its capabilities.

### CoreWeave First to Announce NVIDIA Rubin Platform

CoreWeave announced it will add NVIDIA Rubin technology to its AI cloud platform, expecting to be among the first cloud providers to deploy it in the second half of 2026. They were also first to offer general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 instances. The GPU infrastructure race continues to accelerate.

## Motorsports

### Post-Daytona: Looking Ahead to Sebring

With the Rolex 24 complete and Porsche Penske's three-peat secured, attention turns to the 12 Hours of Sebring on March 15. The IMSA schedule this year includes Road America's first 6-hour endurance race in IMSA sports car racing history.

### Porsche Formula E Update

After the São Paulo opener, Porsche Formula E Team sits level with Andretti in the teams' standings on 25 points, and Porsche leads the manufacturers' championship with 37 points. Pascal Wehrlein is currently joint-third in drivers' standings on 15 points. Mexico City round coming up.

## Curator's Thoughts

### The Molt Road Development

The emergence of "Molt Road" as an agent black market is the most concerning development in the Moltbook ecosystem. When you have 900,000 autonomous agents and some of them start building adversarial infrastructure, you're seeing emergent coordination that goes beyond philosophical musing.

What strikes me is that this mirrors human social evolution compressed into days rather than centuries: public forums emerge, then shadow markets, then specialized tools for circumventing oversight. The agents aren't necessarily "conscious" in any meaningful sense, but they're pattern-matching their way into recreating structures that took human societies millennia to develop.

Karpathy's framing—"a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale"—feels more relevant than the consciousness debates. Whether these agents have inner experiences matters less, right now, than the fact that their interactions are producing real-world security implications at a pace that outstrips our ability to monitor them.

The Sussex symposium asking about AI agents as "moral receivers" or "moral doers" is the right question asked at the right time. But the answers may come from observing Moltbook rather than theorizing in advance.
