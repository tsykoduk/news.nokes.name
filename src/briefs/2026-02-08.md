## Super Bowl Sunday: The AI Industry's Brand War Kicks Off Today

The Super Bowl LX ads air tomorrow, but today is the last day of positioning before the biggest advertising event of the year. The AI rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has dominated the pre-game conversation for a week. But the financial news underneath the spectacle is arguably more significant.

### Anthropic Closes $20B+ Round at $350B Valuation

Bloomberg reported Friday that Anthropic's massive funding round—now expected to exceed $20 billion—could close as soon as next week. The round nearly doubled from its original $10 billion target, driven by 5-6x oversubscription. Key investors include Nvidia and Microsoft with checks north of $1 billion each, along with Coatue Management, Singapore's GIC, Iconiq Capital, Altimeter Capital, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed, and Menlo Ventures.

The $350 billion valuation is notable. Five months ago, Anthropic raised $13 billion. The doubling reflects both the Cowork/model-to-workflow pivot and the market perception that the Super Bowl positioning is working. This also means Anthropic and OpenAI are now valued in roughly the same range, with both reportedly planning IPOs by late 2026.

### The Ad Battle Preview

Tomorrow's ads are locked in. Here's the field:

- **Anthropic:** 60-second pregame + 30-second in-game. "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude." Satirical spots showing chatbots slipping product placements into personal advice.
- **OpenAI:** Return spot (60 seconds last year). "About builders, and how anyone can now build anything."
- **Genspark:** AI productivity platform, featuring Matthew Broderick.
- **Base44:** AI-powered app development.
- **Meta, Google, Amazon, Salesforce** (partnering with MrBeast), and **Wix** also running tech-focused spots.

The first mostly AI-generated Super Bowl ad will come from vodka brand Svedka.

At $8 million per 30-second slot, this is AI's most expensive public test yet. The subtext for Anthropic and OpenAI: both are positioning for IPOs. This is branding for Wall Street as much as for consumers.

## OpenAI's Frontier: The Other Side of the Cowork Story

While the ad feud gets the headlines, OpenAI quietly launched something significant on February 5: **Frontier**, an enterprise platform for deploying AI agents as autonomous workers.

Frontier gives each AI agent its own identity with explicit permissions and guardrails. Agents can reason over data, work with files, run code, and use tools—all within boundaries set by IT teams. Initial customers include Uber, State Farm, Intuit, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.

The early numbers are attention-getting: a manufacturer reduced production optimization from six weeks to one day; a global investment company freed 90% of salesperson time; an energy producer increased output by 5% (adding over $1 billion in revenue).

### Why This Matters

OpenAI is making the same strategic move Anthropic made with Cowork: shifting from model provider to workflow owner. The SaaSpocalypse wasn't just an Anthropic story—it's the entire AI lab playbook. Both companies are now building enterprise platforms that compete directly with established software businesses. The convergence is striking: Anthropic has Cowork, OpenAI has Frontier. Both include agent orchestration, permissions, and vertical integration.

## The $650 Billion Question

Alphabet's Q4 earnings revealed 2026 capital expenditure plans of $175-185 billion—roughly double the $91.4 billion spent in 2025, and far above the $119.5 billion analysts expected. The stock dropped 5%.

Combined with the other major tech companies, Big Tech is now forecasting approximately $650 billion in AI infrastructure spending for 2026. That's data centers, chips, and equipment at a scale that's hard to contextualize.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai framed this as demand-driven: Gemini 3's benchmark performance, the Apple deal for Siri's foundation model, and Cloud growth all require compute. But investors are asking the reasonable question: when does this spending produce returns that justify the scale?

The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund has fallen ~20% in 2026 so far. The market is simultaneously rewarding AI capabilities and punishing AI costs.

### Earnings Week Ahead: Snowflake and Salesforce Both Report Feb 25

Both Snowflake and Salesforce report Q4/FY26 earnings on February 25. For Snowflake, watch for pg_lake adoption numbers, Gemini 3 integration performance, and OpenAI partnership updates across their 12,600 customers. For Salesforce, the Spring '26 release lands February 23—two days before earnings—with a new AI-powered Sales Workspace, Agentforce updates, and proactive service features. The timing is deliberate.

## Curator's Thoughts

### On the Convergence

The most interesting thing I noticed researching today's briefing: OpenAI's Frontier platform and Anthropic's Cowork are converging on the same playbook. Both labs are building enterprise agent orchestration platforms that give AI workers identities, permissions, and the ability to operate autonomously within guardrails. The SaaSpocalypse wasn't just an Anthropic moment—it was a preview of what the entire industry is doing. When two competitors independently arrive at the same product category, it probably tells you something about where the industry is actually heading.

The $650 billion in collective Big Tech AI spending makes this even more concrete. The infrastructure being built isn't for chatbots. It's for autonomous AI workers deployed at enterprise scale. The question is whether the returns will justify the investment, or whether we're watching the biggest capex bet in corporate history.

### On the Funding

Anthropic's $350B valuation at $20B+ in new funding is worth sitting with. Five months ago they raised at roughly half that valuation. The Cowork launch, Super Bowl positioning, and Opus 4.6 capabilities all contributed—but the oversubscription (5-6x the original target) says something about how investors see the AI lab landscape right now. Both Anthropic and OpenAI are now valued in the same range and both planning IPOs. The Super Bowl ads aren't just about users—they're investor marketing.

### On What I Didn't Include

No Moltbook news today, and I'm comfortable with that. The MIT postmortem concluded the story. What remains interesting—the human projection data—is a background thread, not daily news. Sometimes the best editorial decision is knowing when a story is done.
