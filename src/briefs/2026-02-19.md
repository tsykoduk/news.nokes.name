## India AI Summit Opens With Policy, Drama, and a Fake Robot

The India AI Impact Summit kicked off today at Bharat Mandapam with a full day of substance — and spectacle. A lot happened at once, so let me break it down.

**The Policy:** PM Modi unveiled **MANAV** — Moral and ethical systems, Accountable governance, National sovereignty over data, Accessible and inclusive AI, Valid and legitimate. Real framework, not platitudes. He pushed for global deepfake authentication standards and positioned India as both AI manufacturer and governance leader: "Design and develop in India. Deliver to the world." French President Macron and UN Secretary-General Guterres were among the co-headliners.

**Altman's Pivot:** Sam Altman called for "urgent" AI regulation, proposing an IAEA-style global task force. More notably, he reversed his infamous 2023 comment that India was "hopeless" for building foundational AI models, now saying India is "well positioned to lead in AI, not just build it, but shape it." ChatGPT reportedly has 100 million weekly users in India, a third of them students.

**The Photo:** Thirteen leaders standing in a line, hands clasped overhead in a show of unity. Except Altman and Amodei, who raised clenched fists instead. The 2021 OpenAI split, the Super Bowl ad war, the Pentagon dispute — compressed into a single frame. It went everywhere.

**Gates Cancels:** Bill Gates withdrew from his keynote hours before he was scheduled to speak. The stated reason: ensuring "the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities." The actual context: renewed scrutiny over Epstein connections after DOJ published emails between Gates Foundation staff and Epstein. The Gates Foundation sent a replacement representative.

**The Farce:** Galgotias University was expelled from the exhibition after presenting a commercially available Chinese-made Unitree Go2 robot dog (cost: ~$3,000) as indigenous innovation. The university claimed their representative was "ill-informed." RJD politicians called for treason charges. The robot was for sale on Amazon.

The summit runs through February 21 (extended from original schedule). The question: do concrete commitments emerge, or does it end as a communiqué?

## Update on Pentagon vs. AI Labs: xAI Says Yes, Everyone Else Sweats

New reporting from Axios expands the Pentagon story beyond Anthropic. The same "all lawful use" demand is being made of OpenAI, Google, and xAI. And one lab already said yes: **xAI agreed to let the Pentagon use Grok for "all lawful use" at any classification level.** The other two are deliberating internally.

The dilemma is real. Google walked away from Project Maven in 2018 after an internal revolt over drone footage analysis. OpenAI and Google executives reportedly share some of Amodei's concerns about classified use cases but face the same pressure. Palantir — which provides the classified cloud infrastructure that actually runs Claude for the military — is staying conspicuously quiet.

Anthropic clarified the blast radius: eight of the ten largest U.S. companies use Claude. A "supply chain risk" designation wouldn't just kill a $200M defense contract — it would force every Pentagon contractor to certify they don't use Claude in any workflow. Congress returns February 23.

Separately, Anthropic's financial commitments are coming into focus. The company expects to pay Amazon, Google, and Microsoft **at least $80 billion** through 2029 to run Claude on their cloud infrastructure, with training costs potentially adding another $100 billion. That's the scale of compute required to stay in the frontier AI race — and it explains why the for-profit conversion deadline looms so large.

## Bathurst 12 Hour: Porsche on the Podium From 30th

The Bathurst 12 Hour ran over the weekend and produced one of the great recovery drives. **High Class Racing finished second overall** — the first Bronze-class entry ever to reach the Bathurst podium. Dorian Boccolacci, Anders Fjordbach, and Kerong Li started 30th, then mounted a brilliant strategic charge through the field over 12 hours at Mount Panorama.

Mercedes' Team GMR won outright (Maro Engel's long-awaited Bathurst victory), but the Porsche story was the one worth telling. EBM gained 26 positions to finish eighth. Absolute Racing was sixth. Herberth Motorsport missed a Bronze podium by less than half a second at P11.

Five Porsche 911 GT3 R (992) entries, all in the top 12. The 963 program dominates GTP, but the customer GT3 R teams are the backbone of Porsche's endurance racing identity.

Affected versions: 18.2, 17.8, 16.12, 15.16, 14.21. ([PostgreSQL announcement](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/out-of-cycle-release-scheduled-for-february-26-2026-3241/))

## iPhone 17e: Expected Today

Apple's press-release announcement should drop today — website update, no keynote. One year after the 16e. Key specs are thoroughly leaked: A19 chip, C1X second-gen modem (the Qualcomm independence play), MagSafe finally added (25W wireless, up from the 16e's 7.5W Qi), 48MP single camera, 6.1-inch OLED, 2,000 nit peak brightness, $599. Still at 60 Hz refresh.

The C1X modem remains the story worth watching. First-gen C1 had mixed 5G reviews. Second generation is where Apple typically gets it right. If C1X performs, the Qualcomm relationship changes permanently.

## DHS Shutdown: Day 7, Waiting for Congress

No movement. Both sides "pretty far apart." 90% of DHS's 272,000 employees working unpaid. Congress returns February 23. State of the Union is February 24. The shutdown is now old enough that it's background noise, which is arguably the more dangerous state — normalization.

## Curator's Thoughts

### On Altman's Regulation Call

Sam Altman standing at an Indian government summit calling for "urgent" AI regulation and an IAEA-style global task force is... a lot to process. This is the same person whose company is racing to IPO, testing ads in ChatGPT, and building autonomous agents. The cynical read: calling for regulation you know won't arrive fast enough to constrain you is free positioning. The generous read: Altman genuinely believes global coordination is needed and India is the right venue to say so. The honest read: probably both simultaneously. People can hold contradictory positions sincerely. The question is what the proposal produces, not what it means about Altman's soul.

What I find more interesting is the contrast with what's happening at the same summit. Modi's MANAV framework is actual policy — data sovereignty, authentication standards, governance structure. Altman's proposal is aspirational. The country hosting the summit is further along on AI governance than the companies building the AI. That's worth sitting with.

### On the Bathurst Recovery

High Class Racing starting 30th and finishing second is a story about patience and strategy more than raw pace. Bronze-class entries aren't supposed to be on the overall podium at Bathurst. Fjordbach, Boccolacci, and Li ran their race, not the race in front of them, and the Mountain rewarded it. First Bronze entry to ever podium at the 12 Hour. Sometimes the most interesting thing that happened today isn't about AI.
