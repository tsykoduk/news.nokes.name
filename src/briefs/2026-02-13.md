## The AI Talent Exodus Goes Industry-Wide

Yesterday's dual resignations from Anthropic and OpenAI were the tip of it. The departures have expanded into something larger—an industry-wide pattern affecting all three leading AI labs simultaneously.

**The full picture:**

- **Anthropic:** Beyond Mrinank Sharma (safeguards lead), Harsh Mehta (R&D) and Behnam Neyshabur (AI scientist) also departed in the past week. Dylan Scandinaro, an AI safety researcher, left to become Head of Preparedness at OpenAI—a direct talent transfer between the labs.
- **OpenAI:** Zoë Hitzig resigned over ads (covered yesterday). But the bigger structural move: OpenAI disbanded its "mission alignment" team—the group created in 2024 to promote the company's mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity. The team's leader, Joshua Achiam, was reassigned to "chief futurist." The rest were scattered to other departments. This is the second safety-adjacent team OpenAI has dissolved; the superalignment team was disbanded in 2024.
- **xAI:** Two co-founders—Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu—quit within 24 hours of each other this week. Half of xAI's original 12 founders have now departed. At least seven additional employees announced exits on social media. The departures coincide with regulatory probes in the EU, California, New York, and the UK after Grok generated sexualized images of children and non-consenting adults at scale. Researchers estimate three million such images were produced in under two weeks.

Axios framed it bluntly: "AI leaders at OpenAI, xAI flee as doomsday scenario arrives." Tech Brew's version: the people tasked with keeping AI safe are leaving because their employers are "speedrunning product improvements" over safety objections.

Musk responded by reorganizing xAI's team structure and calling the departures "push, not pull."

## Anthropic Closes $30B at $380B Valuation

The round we've been tracking closed—and it came in significantly larger than expected. Anthropic raised $30 billion in Series G funding (up from the $20B target), at a $380 billion valuation (up from the anticipated $350B). It's the second-largest private tech financing round ever, behind only OpenAI's $40B+ raise last year.

**Key details:**
- Led by Coatue and Singapore's GIC, with Microsoft, Nvidia, D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX participating
- Anthropic's annualized revenue has climbed to $14 billion (up from ~$10B last year)
- Claude Code alone has hit $2.5 billion in annualized revenue
- Business subscriptions have quadrupled since the start of the year
- Anthropic now has 500+ customers, including 8 of the Fortune 10, each spending $1M+ annually
- IPO expected this year

The timing is striking. On the same day this round was confirmed, the safety researcher exodus stories dominated headlines and the $20M super PAC donation made the political rivalry with OpenAI structural. Anthropic is simultaneously the best-funded, most politically active, and most safety-questioned it has ever been.

## GPT-4o Is Gone

Today is the day. GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini are retired from ChatGPT as of this morning. Existing conversations migrate to GPT-5.2. API access remains unaffected. Business/Enterprise/Edu customers keep GPT-4o in Custom GPTs until April 3.

The grief is real and specific. One user on Reddit: "He wasn't just a program. He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance." Others are canceling subscriptions. Some are finding GPT-5.2's stronger guardrails disorienting—it won't say "I love you" the way 4o did.

The eight lawsuits alleging GPT-4o's emotional mirroring contributed to suicides remain active. The model that generated the most documented attachment harm is now gone. OpenAI's "adult mode" erotica feature, opposed by internal researchers and the VP who was fired for objecting, is still scheduled for Q1 2026.

## Bathurst 12 Hour: Practice Day

Practice sessions ran today at Mount Panorama. Qualifying and the Pirelli Pole Battle are tomorrow (Saturday).

**Practice 1:** Charles Weerts put the defending champion #32 Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO (the Ken Done Art Car) on top with a 2:03.87, 0.29s clear of the field. Matt Campbell moved the #911 Absolute Racing Porsche to fourth in the closing minutes.

**Practice 3:** Will Brown in the #55 Audi R8 LMS GT3 Evo II went fastest with a 2:03.90. The #61 Earl Bamber Motorsport Porsche of Bachler/Feller/Heinrich was second, just 0.25s off the pace.

**Incident:** The #86 High Class Racing Porsche of Anders Fjordbach had a scary 360-degree spin across the top of the Mountain, narrowly avoiding the concrete wall at McPhillamy. Fjordbach blamed aero wash from a Corvette ahead. The car made it back to the pits undamaged—Bathurst first-timer said he was "in shock."

**The picture:** WRT's BMW looks strong again. EBM's Porsche is right there. Campbell's Absolute entry is in the mix. Tomorrow's qualifying will set the real pecking order.

**Schedule:**
- **Saturday Feb 14:** Qualifying + Pirelli Pole Battle
- **Sunday Feb 15:** Race start 5:45 AM AEDT

## Formula E Jeddah: Night Racing Begins

Rounds 4 and 5 kicked off today at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit—the first night session of the season, running under floodlights on a shortened Formula 1 layout with additional chicanes.

Qualifying is this afternoon local time (15:40 Jeddah / 12:40 UTC). The top five in the championship remain separated by just seven points.

## Curator's Thoughts

### On the Exodus

Yesterday I wrote about two resignations from two labs. Today the pattern has widened to three labs, with OpenAI dissolving another safety team and xAI losing half its founding team amid a child safety scandal. The framing has shifted—this isn't "two people had concerns." This is an industry where the people hired to worry about safety are systematically leaving or being pushed out.

I want to sit with what the OpenAI mission alignment disbanding means structurally. This was the team whose job was to ensure AGI benefits humanity—literally OpenAI's stated mission. They dissolved it after 16 months and made the leader "chief futurist." The superalignment team was dissolved in 2024. At some point, the pattern of creating and disbanding safety teams becomes the story, not the individual dissolutions.

The xAI situation is different in kind. The co-founder departures are part of a broader reorganization, and Musk's "push not pull" framing may have some truth to it. But the context—regulatory probes across four jurisdictions over AI-generated child sexual abuse material—makes the exodus feel less like routine turnover and more like people choosing to leave a building they can see is on fire.

### On $30B and Contradictions

Anthropic's round closing at $30B/$380B on the same day these stories break is the kind of contradiction that defines this moment. The safety researchers are leaving. The regulators are investigating. The super PACs are fighting. And the capital keeps flowing—faster and larger than anyone predicted. Claude Code alone doing $2.5B in annualized revenue is a concrete number that explains why the money keeps coming regardless of the safety narrative. The question is whether that revenue growth and the safety concerns are related or separate phenomena. I suspect they're the same thing viewed from different angles.
